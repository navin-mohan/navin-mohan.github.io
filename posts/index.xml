      <description>Yesterday, I came across an interesting repository on my GitHub feed. It is a simple and functional header-only C++ library that lets you apply transformations like map, reduce and filter to standard C++ containers.
Well, yes I&amp;rsquo;m aware of the fact that it is possible to perform all three transformations using just STL.
 Map - std::transform Filter - std::copy_if Reduce - std::accumulate  This stackoverflow answer explains them in detail.</description>

      <description>If you have ever dealt with binary data, then the chances are that you must have come across the term endianness at least once.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a deeper dive and see how you can keep your bytes in order.
If you&amp;rsquo;re here for the code, then skip ahead to methods.
What is endianness? Endianness is basically the sequential order in which bytes are organized in a word. Generally, the computer memory is byte addressable therefore it doesn&amp;rsquo;t care how the constituent bytes are organized.</description>
